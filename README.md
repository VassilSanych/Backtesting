### Backtesting

**Backtesting of crypto trading robots**

There are fast indicators for optimization purposes:
* ATR,
* EMA,
* SMMA,
* RSI,
* Bolinger Bands,
* Parabolic Sar,
* ADX,
* ADXR

I can also download the history from Kraken and Bitmex, both from their archive and via the API (in the plans of Binance and Bybit). 

I optimize formalized strategies based on historical data, and create robots working through the API.

But that code is not posted here.
